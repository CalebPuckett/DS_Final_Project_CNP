# DS-450 Capstone Project
This is the final project for Bellarmine University's Data Science Capstone Course. It involves predicting credit default likelihood based on variables which are not current determinants of credit score. The goal was to use these more general data, which do not depend on previous borrowing, to predict the likelihood of credit risk or the likelihood of defaulting on a loan.

# Project Proposal
A project proposal is included.

# Exploratory data analysis
EDA is included with a report and files from Python, and Tableau.

# Preliminary Predictive Model
A preliminary model, which contains some of the methods used in the final model, is included as a Python file.

# Poster
A poster is included in PowerPoint form and pdf form.

# Final Predictive Model
A model with more robust analysis is attached.
